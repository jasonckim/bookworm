# Challenge 3: Google Books API Search

## Tech Stack

I used React.JS for this project. 

## Functionality 

This app returns a list of 10 books based on the search term you input. You can then see:\
-`Book Cover`\
-`Title`\
-`Author`\
-`Published Date`\
-`Collapsable Description`\

In addition, you can sort the books by publish date, from `Oldest` to `Newest`.
